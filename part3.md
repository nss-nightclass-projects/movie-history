# Movie History: Part 3 - Create and Read

## Requirements
### Read
* Your site should display ALL movies in the system.  How this is displayed is up to you.

* Each movie should have a button add the movie to your watchlist.

* Each movie should have a button to rate a movie.

### Create
* Create a form that saves a movie to the movies collection

* When a user clicks the watchlist button on a movie, that movie should get saved to the UserMovie collection.  Once an item is on your users watchlist it should show that - its up to you how you do this.  You can make a separate view for watchlist OR indicate that a movie is on the watchlist from the full movies view.

* When a user clicks the rating button that movie should get saved to the UserMovie collection.  For MVP hard code the rating to 5 (there is a bonus feature to set real ratings).

## BONUS
* Rating system - having the rating on a movie set to 5 is DUMB.  Make it so when you click the rating button something either pops up or displays for you to put in an actual rating.

* Add in some more CREATE functionality - build out the People, Role, and MoviePeopleRole collections.
