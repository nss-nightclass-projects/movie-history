# Movie History: Part 4 - Update and Delete

## Requirements
### Delete
* Movies on your watchlist should have a delete button.  Pushing this button should remove the record from the UserMovie collection.

### Update
There are two possible places to update this project.  Do AT LEAST one of the following:
* Movies on your watchlist should still have a rating button so your user can rate the movie after they watch it.  When the rating button is clicked update the UserMovies collection so isWatched is set to true and the rating appears (rating set to 5 for MVP)
* If you completed the rating bonus in part 3, allow your user to change the rating they added.

## BONUS
* Add in any more functionality that you choose.
